# Algorithms in Java and C++

This is a repo that summarizes my coursework in **Analysis of Algorithms**.

**Language**: Java / C++

**Covers**:
  1. (REVIEW) Linked List Implementation of Stacks, Queues, (ordered) Linked List in ***C++***
  2. Hash Table Implementation in ***C++***
  3. Raddix Sort in ***C++***
  4. Huffman Coding in ***Java***
  5. Quad Trees in ***C++***
  6. (REVIEW) Reverse Binary Tree and Pre-/In-/Post-order Traversal in ***Java***
  7. Scheduling & Partial Ordering in ***Java***
  8. Minimum Spanning Tree using (1) Prim's and (2) Kruskal's Algorithm in ***C++***
  9. A* Algorithm (8 Puzzle Problem) in ***Java***

**Note**:
Some of these implementations are not *asymptotically optimal*. However, these were implemented while strictly following specific specs/guidelines provided by the instructor--whose intention was perhaps to choose the algorithm steps that help us better understand the concepts, rather than the ones that are more efficient.
